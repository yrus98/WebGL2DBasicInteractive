# WebGL2DBasicInteractive
 WebGL 2D interactive planar rendering with 2D translation, rotation, scaling/zooming

Objectives:

● WebGL programming

● Creation and rendering of simple 2D geometric shapes as primitives

● Transformation of 2D objects and scene -- instance-wise implementation

● Key(board) events for changing control modes, and transformation implementation

● Mouse events for picking points and objects
